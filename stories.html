<p><span class="title1"><font color="#e0134f">The legend of the Tie Club</font></span></p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard the story of how we met by this point then you must not be listening to us! But, as a refresher, here it goes&#133;</p>

<p>One hot, sticky day in September of 2001, Jannah, then, an adventure seeking, first-year student at the Rhode Island School of Design, decided that she would peruse the School&rsquo;s block party in the upper quad. RISD clubs and organizations were set up at tables, luring people with free candy and do-dads, all of which were completely irresistible to Jannah, so much so that she claims to have signed up for EVERY single club and organization that RISD had to offer, just to get the stuff&mdash;from RISD cheerleading (the Jockstraps) to things involving religion (again&mdash;she emphasizes, there was <b>FREE</b> stuff being handed out with every signature).</p>

<p class="p-special"><span class="title2">Enter Phil.</span></p>

<p>Phil&rsquo;s story actually begins two weeks prior with John giving Phil, Joram, and Andrew (maybe it was Cisco? &#133; At least two Gonzali were there) each a tie &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; from Savers in East Providence before they headed out to a party that evening.</p>

<p>Now, those of you who know John, aren&rsquo;t surprised when we tell you that the Tie Club was totally his idea. He thought it would be amusing to wear these ties, and if anyone asked why they were all wearing said ties to tell them that they&rsquo;re in some super exclusive club.</p>

<p class="p-special"><span class="title2">Back to the RISD block party&#133;</span></p>

<p>That same summer day, Phil was hanging out in John&rsquo;s dorm room at RISD (John also went to RISD) along with Joram and Andrew/Cisco&mdash;or all the Gonzali brothers. Bored, they all decide to walk over to upper quad to check out this block party.</p> 

<p>Upon arrival, they see it&mdash;an <i>empty</i> table. They decided to do what anyone would do: hijack it.</p>

<p><span class="title3">JOHN:</span> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s our club?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">PHIL:</span> <a href="/images/tie_club.jpg" target="_blank"><b>&ldquo;THE TIE CLUB.&rdquo;</b></a></p>

<p>They run back to John&rsquo;s dorm to grab the Savers ties. They also grab pens, paper, and poster board and meet back at the quad to set up shop. After which, Phil and his friends played this like all early-twenty-something males would do&mdash;they made sure every single RISD girl at the block party signed up. With their phone number.</p>

<p class="p-special"><span class="title2">Here&rsquo;s how it went:</span></p>

<p><span class="title3">Unsuspecting RISD female:</span> &ldquo;What do you guys do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">JORAM:</span> &ldquo;We do charity work, volunteer, and have club meetings. Really fun and you get to meet new people.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">RISD female:</span> &ldquo;OK!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">JORAM:</span> &ldquo;GREAT! Put your name here, and don&rsquo;t forget your PHONE NUMBER here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the same conversation but with a RISD male&#133;</p>

<p><span class="title3">Curious RISD male:</span> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Tie Club?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">PHIL: [with apprehension]</span> &ldquo;Well, we do charity work and lots and lots of labor intensive volunteer work&mdash;REALLY boring, time-consuming stuff. You probably won&rsquo;t wanna join.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">Confused, RISD male:</span> &ldquo;OK&#133;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that Tie Club sign-up sheet was a one Ms. Jannah Townsend, and, though she will explain that she signed up for every club, what&rsquo;s more ridiculous are the events that happened next.</p>

<p class="p-special"><span class="title2">The phone call goes like this:</span></p>

<p><span class="title3">PHIL:</span> &ldquo;Hi, Jannah? This is Phil from the Tie Club.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">JANNAH:</span> &ldquo;Oh, hi Phil, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">PHIL:</span> &ldquo;Well, I wanted to invite you to a Tie Club party that we&rsquo;re having this weekend.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">JANNAH:</span> &ldquo;OK, cool. Where at?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">PHIL:</span> &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s sort of a hike, so we&rsquo;ll pick you guys up in the quad and drive you there. Is that cool? Pick you up at 11:30?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="title3">JANNAH:</span> &ldquo;Yeah, sounds good. See you then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, Ed & Olivia [Jannah&rsquo;s parents], this is where you turn a blind-eye to the fact that your 18-year-old daughter got into some stranger&rsquo;s car (Josh Ford&rsquo;s) and was driven to some random house about a mile away from the RISD campus. Remembering that, had she not gone, she may not have met her soulmate&#133;</p>

<p>The meeting itself was normal; &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Phil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Jannah, thanks for picking us up and driving us to this party.&rdquo; The party itself was your typical college house party, but with maybe an a-typical ending. Without giving out too many details, it abruptly ended with the apartment owner chasing a certain red-headed party guest out of the house with a giant kitchen knife. Neither Phil or Jannah&mdash;or anyone else (we don&rsquo;t think)&mdash;were harmed by the knife, or the excessive amounts of drinking (which of course did not involve Jannah or Phil because they were responsible&mdash;even back then).</p>

<p>Phil and Jannah would run into each other at various parties that year but they wouldn&rsquo;t actually start running into each other &ldquo;on purpose&rdquo; until Jannah&rsquo;s sophomore year. Of course, there are stories of their interactions during that first year but we&rsquo;re getting tired of typing so you&rsquo;re just going to have to ask us in October! Moreover, there was no serious &ldquo;D.T.R.-ing&rdquo; (Defining The Relationship) until later on in the Spring of 2003. Nonetheless, Jannah and Phil both feel the defining moment in their courtship happened on a breezy, cool October night at Narragansett Beach.</p>

<p>And, well, the rest is history.</p>
